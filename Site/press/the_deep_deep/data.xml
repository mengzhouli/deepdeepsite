    <description>
        The Deep Deep is a game about exploration, puzzle solving and battle in a dark 2D world.  Command a small squad of dwarves as they delve deeper and deeper into the shattered remains of their civilization looking for companions and treasure.

    <history>
        The Deep Deep is developed by Geoff Lang, Vince Price and Andrew Patten as a weekend-only passion project.  Geoff and Vince wanted to create an experience that involved exploring a detailed 2D world which the player has to illuminate themself.  Over 5 years it has grown from simple concepts to a full-fledged game.
